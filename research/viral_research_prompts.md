A collection of prompts that went viral on Reddit, X, and research communities. These turn Claude into a research tool that can do 10 hours of work in 60 seconds.

## 1. The Contradictions Finder

Perfect for papers, reports, or long docs. Catches things humans gloss over.

```
List all internal contradictions, unresolved tensions, or claims that don't fully follow from the evidence.
```

---

## 2. The "Reviewer #2" Prompt

Yes, *that* reviewer. Brutal. Necessary.

```
Critique this like a skeptical peer reviewer. Be harsh. Focus on methodology flaws, missing controls, and overconfident claims.
```

---

## 3. The "Turn This Into a Paper" Prompt

Use this when you dump raw notes, links, or half-baked ideas. This alone replaces hours of cleanup.

```
Turn the following material into a structured research brief. Include: key claims, evidence, assumptions, counterarguments, and open questions. Flag anything weak or missing.
```

---

## 4. The "Explain It Backwards" Trick

Great for checking real understanding. If the logic collapses, you'll see it immediately.

```
Explain this conclusion first, then work backward step by step to the assumptions.
```

---

## 5. The "Compare Like a Scientist" Prompt

Not feature lists. Real comparisons.

```
Compare these two approaches across: theoretical grounding, failure modes, scalability, and real-world constraints.
```

---

## 6. The "What Would Break This?" Prompt

Gold for forecasting. Most people never ask this.

```
Describe scenarios where this approach fails catastrophically. Not edge cases. Realistic failure modes.
```

---

## 7. The "What Changed My Mind?" Closer

This is how real researchers think.

```
After analyzing all of this, what should change my current belief?
```

---

## 8. The One-Page Mental Model

If it can't compress, you don't own it yet.

```
Compress this entire topic into a single mental model I can remember.
```

---

## 9. The "Translate Across Domains" Prompt

This unlocks insight, not just understanding.

```
Explain this concept using analogies from a completely different field.
```

---

## 10. The "Steal the Structure" Trick

This is underrated. Use it on great papers and essays.

```
Ignore the content. Analyze the structure, flow, and argument pattern. Why does this work so well?
```

---

## 11. The Assumption Stress Test

Comes straight from research forums.

```
List every assumption this argument relies on. Now tell me which ones are most fragile and why.
```
