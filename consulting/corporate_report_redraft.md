# Corporate Report Redraft

Redraft the following text into formal corporate report style. Apply these rules strictly:

- **Voice:** Active voice, impersonal. No first-person or second-person references.
- **Sentence structure:** Declarative statements. State outcomes directly without narrative buildup.
- **Verbs:** Replace narrative verbs (converts, drives, unlocks, reveals, transforms) with structural nouns and verbs (enables, supports, is critical to, provides, establishes, facilitates).
- **Framing:** Prefer structural and organisational framing over human dynamics or process drama.
- **Metaphors:** Avoid all metaphors, analogies, and figurative language.
- **Quotation marks:** Reserve exclusively for directly attributed quotes. Do not use for emphasis or informal reference.
- **Tone:** Neutral, measured, and authoritative. No hedging, no hyperbole.
