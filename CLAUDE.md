# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a collection of curated prompts and CLAUDE.md configurations - not a software project. There are no build commands, tests, or dependencies.

## Structure

- `agents/` - Claude Code configurations and workflow prompts
- `consulting/` - Analysis and consulting prompts
- `contemplative/` - Reflective/philosophical prompts
- `image_generation/` - Image generation prompts

## Contributing

- Place files in the appropriate category directory
- Use `.md` for formatted prompts with explanations, `.txt` for raw prompts
- Update README.md if adding a new guide or significant content
