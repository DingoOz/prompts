# Spec Interview Prompt

A prompt for conducting thorough requirements gathering before writing specifications. Forces the AI to ask deep, non-obvious questions and fully understand the problem space before producing output.

## The Prompt

```
Interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then write the spec to the file
```

## When to Use

- Starting a new feature or project
- When requirements are unclear or complex
- Before writing PRDs or technical specifications
- When you want to surface edge cases and tradeoffs early

## Why It Works

Instead of the AI making assumptions and producing a spec that misses important details, this prompt:

1. **Forces discovery** - Uncovers requirements you hadn't thought of
2. **Surfaces tradeoffs** - Makes you explicitly decide between competing concerns
3. **Avoids rework** - Better specs upfront means fewer revisions later
4. **Documents decisions** - The interview process captures the reasoning behind choices
